    Shopify has been growing at a remarkable rate. This is a company that started in 2005 and is hosting more than 1 million businesses across the world. With increased ease and use of ecommerce, this trend is bound to continue. The pandemic has been a blessing rather than curse for anything and eveything that was virtual; people in lockdown were shopping for all their needs and wishes online. Although pnline shopping was fairly familiar to the younger generation - we have seen a marked change in adoption and comfort of ecommerce all across the population. Shopify makes it easier for any business to marekt their products across the population and across borders, to capture these markets for a profit. It takes away the hurdles to worry and manage the technicalities of their online presence (such as product display and transaction process). In addition to increased ease and adoption of online shopping, the popularity of cryptocurrency and alternative means of finance will further fuel the advantages for businesses to go with  Shopify.
